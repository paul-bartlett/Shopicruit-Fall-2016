# Shopify Developer Intern task solution [Fall 2016]

Alice is organizing a hackathon and she needs to buy some spare computers and keyboards for hackers. She doesnâ€™t have a budget, but wants to spend the least amount of money, while maximizing the sets she can buy. She decided to check out Shopicruit, the awesome store where you can buy the latest Aerodynamic Cotton Keyboards. Using the store's API, help Alice come up with a shopping list of keyboards and computers.

Here is a checklist of her requirements:

* An equal number of computers and keyboards.

* As many different computer and keyboard variants the store has to offer, while buying no duplicate variants.

* Spend the least amount of money possible.

* Alice needs to know the total weight of all computers and keyboards so she can plan for enough volunteers to help carry it all.

You can find the endpoint for Shopicruit's products at: shopicruit.myshopify.com/products.json?page=1 (keep in mind there are multiple pages of results). You can use the Shopicruit API to solve this; the docs are here.
